"""Pinned ``eosd`` runtime-artifact coupling surface (consumer side).

The ENTIRE coupling between the Python host and the external ``/sandbox`` Rust
runtime is: the wire protocol, the data-type contract (see
``sandbox/_contract_fixtures/``), and THIS pin. The host fetches + verifies the
``eosd-linux-{arch}`` binary against the SHA256 recorded here before upload/exec
(verify logic lands in a later phase — this module is data only).

Phase 0 local-upload closeout: the pins are host-local static-musl builds
packaged by ``xtask`` and uploaded with provider ``put_archive``. Minisign stays
empty until the later release-grade provenance gate.
