# Rust Parity Audit — Performance Properties (O(1) lowerdir CoW, O(n·delta) upperdir, fast mount)

Domain: sandbox. Area key: `perf`.

Scope: confirm the Rust port preserves the storage/space/mount complexity
properties of the Python ground truth, and confirm a benchmark exercises the
Rust daemon path. This is an architectural-property check judged from the
mount/copy strategy in code + the bench scripts, not from raw timing.

> NOTE ON GROUND TRUTH: the Python sandbox runtime was **deleted from the
> working tree** in commit `37c13f3db` ("remove legacy python sandbox runtime
> subsystems"). It remains the behavioral ground truth. All Python file:line
> anchors in this report are read from the parent commit `a8c987845` via
> `git show a8c987845:<path>`. The architecture docs under
> `docs/architecture/sandbox/*.html` still describe the intended dynamics and
> are present in-tree.

## Ground truth

### Space-complexity invariant (the headline claim)
- `docs/architecture/sandbox/overview.html` "O(1) space for N concurrent
  operations": *"The repository is copied once into `B000001-base`. N parallel
  agents share that base as read-only lowerdir; each operation pays only for its
  changed bytes in its private upperdir. Disk cost is
  `O(repo) + O(N × changed_bytes)`, not `O(N × repo)`."*
- `docs/architecture/sandbox/layerstack.html` 2.3 Projection: *"A snapshot is
  O(1): a lease plus a list of existing layer paths, not a rendered tree…
  every snapshot is constant-cost regardless of repository size."* Anchored to
  `backend/src/sandbox/layer_stack/stack.py:105-129`.

### O(1) snapshot (Python `acquire_snapshot`)
`backend/src/sandbox/layer_stack/stack.py:108-135` (parent `a8c987845`): acquires
a lease over the current manifest under a lock, then maps `manifest.layers` to
existing on-disk `layer_paths` (`self._layer_path(layer).as_posix()`). No tree is
rendered. Returns `LayerStackSnapshotLease(lease_id, manifest_version, root_hash,
manifest, layer_paths, timings={"layer_stack.acquire_snapshot.total_s": ...})`.

### Upperdir is per-op + O(writes) (Python capture + writable dirs)
- `backend/src/sandbox/overlay/writable_dirs.py:46-52` — `allocate_overlay_writable_dirs`
  makes `run_dir/upper` + `run_dir/work` **per overlay**.
  `OVERLAY_WRITABLE_ROOT = "/eos/mount"`, no fallback (`writable_dirs.py:13-43`).
- `backend/src/sandbox/overlay/capture.py:19-32,49-89` — capture walks **only the
  upperdir** with `os.walk()`; "changed-data cost is tied to the operation's
  writes rather than repository size" (overlay.html 3.3).

### Fast kernel mount + manifest pointer-swap
- `backend/src/sandbox/overlay/kernel_mount.py:49-75` — `mount_overlay` uses
  `fsopen("overlay")`, one `fsconfig_string(fsfd, b"lowerdir+", layer)` per layer
  in **newest-first** order (first = highest priority), then `upperdir`,
  `workdir`, `fsconfig_create`, `fsmount`, `move_mount(workspace_root)`. Mount
  target is `workspace_root`, **not** `/`.
- `backend/src/sandbox/overlay/kernel_mount.py:139-198` — `validate_mount_inputs`
  opens `O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW` fds and passes **lowerdirs** as
  `/proc/self/fd/N`; upper/work/mountpoint stay real paths
  (`move_mount(2)` rejects fd symlinks as destination; overlayfs rejects fd-backed
  upper/work).
- `backend/src/sandbox/layer_stack/publisher.py:49-138` — publish stages a layer,
  fsyncs, renames into `layers/`, CAS-re-reads the manifest, then atomically
  writes a new manifest with the new layer **prepended** (newest-first). This is
  the atomic-pointer-swap (CAS) commit, not a deep copy (layerstack.html 2.4).

### Base copied once = O(repo) (Python workspace base)
- `backend/src/sandbox/layer_stack/workspace_base.py:31-32,82-141` — base built
  once as `B000001-base`; walks the workspace, rejects special/unstable files,
  writes one base layer + manifest version 1 + `workspace.json`.

### Depth-cap constants (auto-squash bounds the read-amp / mount(8) limit)
- `backend/src/sandbox/occ/service.py:34` — `AUTO_SQUASH_MAX_DEPTH = 100`.
- `backend/src/sandbox/occ/maintenance.py:48-60` — after publish, squash only if
  `active.depth <= max_depth` is **false** (operator `<=` → skip).
- `backend/src/sandbox/layer_stack/squash.py:61-93` — plan acceptance operators:
  `active.depth <= max_depth` → None; `len(entries) >= active.depth` → None;
  `active.depth - len(entries) < min_reduction` → None; final
  `len(entries) > max_depth and all(len(seg) <= max_depth …)` → None. Default
  `min_reduction=1`; `can_squash()` passes `2`.
- `backend/src/sandbox/ephemeral_workspace/pipeline.py:455-463` — a **separate**
  shell-pre-mount squash path with default `64`, env-overridable via
  `EOS_SHELL_MOUNT_SQUASH_MAX_DEPTH`. (Docs note mount(8) ≈16 / mount(2) ≈200 as
  the *reasons* a cap exists; neither 16 nor 200 is a code constant — the real
  caps are 100 and 64.)

### Benchmarks (in-tree, Rust daemon)
- `backend/scripts/bench_rust_daemon_phase2.py:56,93,202-231,253-304` — uploads a
  locally packaged `eosd` (`EOSD_REMOTE_PATH = "{RUNTIME_ROOT}/eosd"`,
  default artifact `sandbox/dist/eosd-linux-amd64`), seeds a LayerStack with
  `B000001-base`, starts the Rust daemon.
- `backend/scripts/bench_rust_daemon_phase3.py` — starts the Rust daemon, seeds
  an 8 MiB base-only fixture by default (`--space-fixture-mib`), builds the base
  from the image workspace via `api.build_workspace_base`, then measures
  `api.v1.exec_command` (no-op + small-write publish), `api.v1.glob`,
  `api.v1.grep`, and a **1/3/5/10 concurrent** shell-exec load matrix (no-op +
  unique-write), plus daemon RSS before/between/after. The script now samples
  LayerStack disk usage after base build / before load / after load and folds
  `space.gate_pass` into the top-level gate.

## Invariant table

| # | Invariant | Status | Severity | Python file:line | Rust file:line | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lower-dir O(1): layers shared read-only (CoW), no per-overlay full copy | **match** (with caveat D2) | none | `stack.py:108-135` (lease + existing `layer_paths`, no render) | `stack.rs:343-372` (`acquire_snapshot` maps `manifest.layers`→paths, no `project`) | Per-snapshot work is O(1) lease+path-list (no render). BUT Rust serializes it under the exclusive writer lock (D2) — Python did not. |
| 2 | Upper-dir O(n·delta): each op stores only its own delta in its own upperdir | **match** | none | `writable_dirs.py:46-52`; `capture.py:49-89` | `writable_dirs.rs:65-79` (per-`run_dir` `upper`/`work`); `path_change.rs:155-269` (walks only upperdir) | Per-op `run_dir/upper`; capture walks only upperdir → cost ∝ writes. |
| 3 | Fast: kernel overlayfs mount + manifest CAS pointer-swap, no deep per-op copy | **match** | none | `kernel_mount.py:49-75`; `publisher.py:49-138` | `kernel_mount.rs:106-137`; `stack.rs:618-681` | `lowerdir+` per layer newest-first; fd-backed lowerdirs; `move_mount` onto `workspace_root`; publish = stage→rename→CAS→prepend→atomic manifest. |
| 4 | Benchmarks exercise the Rust daemon (eosd) and measure these properties | **source-covered; live artifact pending** | medium | `bench_rust_daemon_phase2.py:56,202-304`; `phase3.py` | (bench scripts target `eosd`; see below) | Targets eosd + concurrent load and now has a disk-space gate: seed a non-trivial base, sample LayerStack `du`, and fail if any non-base layer looks like a full base copy. The checked-in live report still needs to be rerun after this source change. |

Supporting constant-parity checks (all **match**):

## Disparities

### D1 — Space-complexity gate added to Phase 3 bench; live artifact pending
- Original evidence: `bench_rust_daemon_phase3.py` gated on latency
  (`shell_noop_70pct_faster_than_phase1`) and daemon RSS
  (`sample_daemon_memory`), but had no `du`, on-disk byte accounting, or
  O(N·repo) regression check. Current Phase 3 already built the base through
  `api.build_workspace_base` against the target image workspace, which is a
  stronger fixture than the removed ad hoc tar seeding helper, but it still did
  not measure the disk-space invariant. The older phase2 baseline remains a
  one-file fixture: `bench_rust_daemon_phase2.py:61`
  `README_CONTENT = "# README\n…"`, `:297`
  `…/layers/B000001-base/README.md`.
- Remediation update: the Phase 3 benchmark now seeds an 8 MiB base-only fixture
  by default (`--space-fixture-mib`, set `0` to skip), samples LayerStack disk
  usage with `sample_layer_stack_space` after base build / before load / after
  load, and evaluates `space.gate_pass` with `evaluate_space_accounting`. The
  gate verifies the fixture made it into `B000001-base` and fails if any
  non-base layer's apparent size exceeds the larger of `--space-layer-overhead-bytes`
  (default 1 MiB) or 10% of the base layer. A regression that copies the whole
  base into each operation layer should therefore fail on the first copied layer,
  instead of hiding behind aggregate latency/RSS success.
- Why it matters: invariant 4 asks for a benchmark that *proves* the space
  properties. The benches now have a source-level guard for the headline
  disk-space moat (`O(repo)+O(N·changed_bytes)`, not `O(N·repo)`), in addition to
  the existing latency/RSS gates.
- Remaining follow-up: rerun the live Phase 3 benchmark on the target Docker
  image and check in / cite the resulting JSON report. Until that artifact
  exists, D1 is source-covered but not live-evidence-closed.
- NOT a Rust regression: these are the same bench scripts used for the Python/CP-0
  baseline (`phase2.py:97-100` compares against `bench/baseline-amd64.json`). The
  missing space-accounting gate was a **pre-existing** gap shared with the Python
  baseline, not a check the Rust port dropped.

### D2 — Rust `acquire_snapshot` used the exclusive storage-writer lock; source-level remediation landed
- Original evidence (Python, parent `a8c987845`): `acquire_snapshot` used the
  process-local `self._lock` around `read_active_manifest()` +
  `self._leases.acquire(...)` and did **not** enter `_storage_write_guard()`.
  Mutating methods (`release_lease`, `publish_changes`, `squash`,
  `commit_to_workspace`) used the heavier storage-writer guard.
- Original Rust gap: `LayerStack::acquire_snapshot` took
  `self.writer_lock.exclusive()`, the same in-process serializer used by
  `publish_layer`, `squash`, `release_lease`, and `commit_to_workspace`. Because
  daemon requests open fresh `LayerStack` instances per request, that per-root
  serializer was the real cross-request contention point.
- Remediation update: `StorageWriterLockLease` now exposes a shared read guard
  and a reentrant exclusive write guard. `LayerStack::acquire_snapshot` now takes
  `self.writer_lock.shared()?`; storage mutations keep `exclusive()?`. This
  restores the intended shape: concurrent snapshots can overlap, while publish,
  squash, release, and commit still serialize.
- Verification: `storage_lock::tests::shared_guards_overlap_and_block_exclusive`
  proves shared guards overlap and block a writer;
  `storage_lock::tests::exclusive_guard_is_reentrant_and_blocks_shared` proves
  writer re-entry still works and blocks readers until the outer write guard
  drops. The focused lock tests, full `eos-layerstack` lib tests, and scoped
  Clippy passed.
- Remaining follow-up: re-baseline the Phase 3/Phase 3T N-concurrent throughput
  matrix on a live Docker image. The source-level contention bug is closed; the
  measured throughput gate is not refreshed by this note. The same run should
  also produce the first live `space.gate_pass` evidence for D1.

### D3 — `acquire_snapshot` timings relocated from stack to daemon (divergent, equivalent)
- Evidence: Python `stack.py:108-135` records
  `timings={"layer_stack.acquire_snapshot.total_s": …}` **inside** the snapshot
  method. Rust `stack.rs:370` returns `timings: BTreeMap::new()` (empty). The
  metric is instead recorded at the **daemon** call site
  (`dispatcher.rs:971`, `:1247`; read back by the bench at `dispatcher.rs:3233`).
- Why it matters: behaviorally equivalent — the timing key still exists on the
  RPC response the bench reads. But a direct unit-level consumer of
  `LayerStack::acquire_snapshot` would see no timing. Low risk; flagged for
  completeness so a future reader does not mistake the empty map for a dropped
  metric.
- Suggested fix: none required. Optionally document that snapshot timing is owned
  by the daemon layer in Rust.

---

## Extra findings

- **No deep copy anywhere on the snapshot/mount path.** `MergedView::project`
  (`stack.rs:132-139`) — the only full-tree render — is called solely from
  `commit_to_workspace` (`stack.rs:540`), `build_checkpoint`/squash
  (`squash.rs:234`), and tests, never from `acquire_snapshot` or the overlay
  mount. This matches the Python "projection is a pinned list, not a rendered
  tree" invariant (layerstack.html 2.3 / `stack.py:105-129`).
- **CoW is delegated to the kernel, correctly.** The Rust port never copies
  lower layers; overlayfs copy-up happens in-kernel on first write into the
  private `upperdir`. The fd-pinning of lowerdirs (`kernel_mount.rs:236-238`)
  and the real-path upper/work mirror the Python rationale comment exactly.
- **Whiteout/opaque capture is O(writes), faithful.** `capture_upperdir`
  (`path_change.rs:155-269`) sorts per level, emits opaque-dir before children
  via `emitted_opaque_dirs` dedup, hashes content with SHA-256 — same shape as
  `capture.py`. No lower-layer scan.
- **Publish prepends newest-first + idempotent head short-circuit.**
  `stack.rs:626-628` returns early when the new changeset digest equals the head
  layer digest (matches publisher.py idempotent-duplicate short-circuit), saving
  a redundant layer — a real cost optimization preserved.
- **Auto-squash bounds read-amp on the real path.** `dispatcher.rs:1510` runs
  `run_auto_squash_maintenance` after a successful `publish_layer`, with the same
  `<= 100` gate, keeping per-path read cost (newest-first chain walk) and
  mount(8) layer count bounded — the cost-management half of the O(1)-snapshot
  trade.
- **Other bench scripts also target eosd**: `phase3` derives from `phase2`
  (`upload_artifact`, `call_tcp`), and `bench_rust_daemon_isolated_inspection.py`,
  `bench_rust_daemon_plugin.py`, `bench_rust_daemon_phase3t_*` all reuse the
  `eosd` upload harness (grep confirms `eosd` references in each).

## Open questions

1. The shell-pre-mount squash default `64`
   (`EOS_SHELL_MOUNT_SQUASH_MAX_DEPTH`, `pipeline.py:455-463`) lived in the
   now-deleted Python `ephemeral_workspace`. Does the Rust daemon implement an
   equivalent shell-pre-mount squash, or does it rely solely on the post-publish
   `AUTO_SQUASH_MAX_DEPTH=100` path? (Out of this area's core 4 invariants, but
   relevant to mount(8) depth-cap performance; not located in eos-daemon during
   this pass.)
