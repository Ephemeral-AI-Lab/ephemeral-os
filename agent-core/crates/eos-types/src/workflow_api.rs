//! Delegated-workflow lifecycle API contract.
//!
//! This is the owner-neutral port that the model-facing workflow tools and the
//! engine background workflow manager call. `eos-workflow` implements it;
//! `eos-tools` consumes it and maps [`WorkflowApiError`] onto its own
//! `ToolError` at the tool boundary. The contract lives in `eos-types` so both
//! sides can reach it without a crate cycle: `eos-workflow` already depends on
//! `eos-tools` for tool-core (`ToolName`, `PlannerPlan`, `ToolError`), so the
//! API could not be owned by `eos-workflow` and still be consumed by
//! `eos-tools`.
//!
//! Workflows are keyed by their natural [`WorkflowId`]; there is no synthetic
//! `wf_<n>` session handle.
