//! The three plugin dispatch modes, selected from `(intent, auto_workspace_overlay)`.
//!
//! # MF-1 — ONE writer per `layer_stack_root` (STATE LOUDLY)
//!
//! Both the WRITE_ALLOWED path AND the self-managed callback path publish through
//! the SAME per-`layer_stack_root` single OCC writer + storage lease. That writer
//! is the existing [`eos_ephemeral::OccRuntimeServicesPort`] (keyed on root so
//! every publish routes through the ONE `occ-commit-queue` writer — MF-1). This
//! crate CONSUMES that port; it NEVER defines a parallel OCC services trait and
//! NEVER links `eos-occ`. A second writer instance for the self-managed callback
//! would silently corrupt the linearization point — so the self-managed mode is
//! generic over the very same [`eos_ephemeral::OccRuntimeServicesPort`] value the
//! primary path uses.
//!
//! # The three modes
//!
//! * [`DispatchMode::ReadOnlyWarmServer`] — `Intent::ReadOnly`: the op runs
//!   OUT-OF-PROCESS in the warm per-session server (no per-call overlay, no ns
//!   child, no publish). Replaces the importlib in-process call.
//! * [`DispatchMode::WriteAllowedEosdOwned`] — `Intent::WriteAllowed` +
//!   `auto_workspace_overlay = true`: `eosd` owns the per-op overlay + the OCC
//!   publish around the warm-server call (the canonical wrapper).
//! * [`DispatchMode::SelfManagedCallback`] — `auto_workspace_overlay = false`:
//!   the plugin manages its own overlay and calls BACK over the PPC channel to
//!   commit; that callback MUST route through the SAME single-writer port (MF-1),
//!   leaving the existing publish path UNCHANGED.
//!
//! Isolated mode blocks ALL plugin dispatch (`ForbiddenInIsolatedWorkspace`).
//!
//! `// PORT backend/src/sandbox/ephemeral_workspace/plugin/op_registry.py:14-23 — intent -> runner`
//! `// PORT backend/src/sandbox/ephemeral_workspace/plugin/op_registry.py:224-237 — _dispatch_runner_for_entry`
